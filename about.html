          <h1>Issues with modern day videos...</h1>
          <body>
               <p>Downloading YouTube videos can be a common need for many users like saving videos and audios for offline viewing, sharing with friends, or creating content. However, several challenges may occur when trying to download YouTube videos.</p>
            
              <p>To begin, the terms and conditions of YouTube explicitly prohibit users from downloading videos and audios. However, there are few exceptions including obtaining specific permission from the content owner or utilizing the "Download" option provided by YouTube on select videos. Violations of these terms may result in account suspension and even legal action.</p>
            
              <p>Furthermore, there are a plethora of third-party apps and websites that claim to provide YouTube video and audio downloading services. However, these may be untrustworthy and promote computer related crimes such as phishing. Furthermore, some might contain viruses or malware, while others might not function effectively.</p>
            
              <p>Additionally, the quality and format of the downloaded videos may not be satisfactory to the user as some applications may only provide low-quality downloads, while others may not support the necessary video format or resolution.
Overall, downloading YouTube videos and audios may be a tedious and complicated task that needs careful consideration of legal and technological aspects.</p>

          <h1>Why was Tubify created?</h1>
          <p>In order to solve this dilemma, we have created a website called Tubify. This website acts as a Simple Web Service which allows a user to download videos and audio from Youtube. This website allows a user to make downloads in two ways.</p>
          
          <p>Firstly, a user can use the website to search and find a desired video, and simply click the “Copy Video ID to Clipboard '' button, where they are then sent an alert when the video id has been successfully copied.</p> 
          
          <p>After, the user must then scroll up, where they can select whether they would like to download the video or the audio of their desired video. After selecting their preference at the top of the screen, a user can then proceed to making their download.</p>
          
          <p>Secondly, a user can copy a video’s url from Youtube beforehand, instead of using the website's search and find feature. Therefore, all a user would have to do next, is to select at the top of the screen, whether they would like to download the video or the audio of their desired video, and proceed accordingly.</p>
